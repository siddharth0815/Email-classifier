aS'  here the email and thank for your help this morn  forward by  houect on 06292000 0241 pm 09 bob rbairdvelawcom 09sent by rebecca rmatthewsvelawcom 0906202000 0912 am 090920 0909 to   enron enroncom 0909 cc20 0909 subject fw no subject  as promis this email discuss the secur law issu involv with equiti deriv i then make a few observ about the relationship between the secur and commod law and i then make some comment on the confirm you sent me both secur law comment and other comment the princip secur law issu relat to the fact that the equiti deriv itself is a secur and to the issu of whether and to what extent a counterparty01 activ in establish or unwind a hedg are attribut to the issuer when enron enter into a deriv and the counterparti goe out into the market to make a purchas is that purchas attribut to enron when it unwind it hedg by make a sale is the counterparty01 sale attribut to enron and therefor requir to be regist here are the princip issu 1 rule 10b5 when enron enter into a deriv it must be sure it doe not have undisclos materi insid inform regard it affair it is my understand that the trader are suppos to check with rex roger on the issu of whether enron possess such inform although it could discharg it oblig under rule 10b5 by disclos the inform to the counterparti that would probabl be unaccept sinc the counterparti would then be in possess of materi insid inform and could not engag in a market transact to hedg thus each time it enter into an equiti deriv in it own stock enron must be confid that the public has avail to it all materi inform regard enron 2 rule 10b18 this rule permit issuer and person act in concert with issuer to repurchas the issuer01 share under a 01safe harbor018 that say in effect tha t if purchas are made pursuant to the rule they won01t be deem to be manipul by reason of the tim ing and amount of the bid or purchas it is typic for an issuer to requir it counterparti to make purchas pursuant to the rule sometim this is a contractu undertak in the confirm and in some case the issuer will simpli obtain an oral commit from the counterparti to engag in it hedg pursuant to the rule obvious it is better to have it in write 3 registr of sale if enron decid to net share settl and issu share to the counterparti those are obvious restrict secur that cannot be sold by the counterparti in the absenc of a registr statement but what about the resal by the issuer when it unwind it hedg that it has put on by buy share in the open market are those sale attribut to the issuer so therefor requir to be regist i have seen lot of counterparti base on advic of their law firm take differ posit on this a some counterparti say that they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer if the econom of the deriv are determin base on the net proceed from the sale it 01s a more difficult case becaus the issuer itself is realiz benefit and detriment from the sale b some counterparti say they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer onli if there is a strong correl at the onset of the contract between the term of the deriv and the hedg it it01 a total return swap for exampl there will be a 11 correspond ie the econom will tell you that the counterparti will buy 100 of the share cover by the swap immedi upon enter into the swap but if it01 someth like a collar with diverg strike price and involv dynam hedg where it01 not clear whether and to what extent the counterparti will make purchas or sale in the ope n market then it01 not as easi to attribut the counterparty01 action to the issuer in those case these counterparti look at the correl and if it01 not that great they don01t ask for registr right c some counterparti say they don01t want registr right for resa les of stock purchas in the open market to hedg their posit credit suiss first boston fall in categori c with respect to the may 200 0 confirm you sent me even though there is a strong correl between the deal and the hedg e ie even though in that case they will no doubt immedi purchas 100 of the share cover by the transact they are onli ask for registr right with respect to the share that are deliv by enron on net share settlement 4 commod law under the commod law there are some risk in do equiti swap in that one has to reli on the swap polici statement rather than the swap exempt but those risk are probabl minim enough that enron is will to take them the swap exempt doe not cover equiti swap with respect to equiti option they are outsid the cftc01s jurisdict altogeth forward contract present the most difficult issu in that there is a lot of case law and cftc lore about the distinct between forward and futur and a key distinct is that forward are physic deliveri contract that bind the parti to make and take deliveri state bucket shop law outlaw contract that purport to be contract for sale of a secur that are to be settl base on market price quotat so i would counsel enron not to enter into ani forward contract that has a cash settlement altern although one can argu that net share settlement has the same defect i don01t feel as strong about that bec aus you could get to where you want to get by physic deliv the share and issu new share s in payment the theori is that you actual deliv share and just net them out that is not quit as bad as fli in the face of the case law and cftc lore on net cash settlement the bear stearn confirm and cancel i realli don01t have ani comment on this i think the cancel was effect to cancel the parti oblig the confirm did not present ani registr issu i guess i would say that if you do someth precisel y like this you might get them to agre to make ani hedg purchas pursuant to rule 10b18 but that01 it the credit suiss first boston confirm this is an extrem well written document for the reason discuss abov i would counsel against enter into this kind of transact with the cash settlement featur in light of the risk that it could be character as an illeg unenforc futur contract a few other comment they say automat earli termin appli but i think that is a realli bad idea enron had an agreement with a counterparti that took bankruptci and enron did not find out about it until a few day later after the market had move sinc enron di d not know of the termin it did not unwind it hedg yet the isda said that the amount payabl on termin would depend on the termin date price so enron took a loss you ought to alway have within your control the right to termin this is especi true of us parti but i would think the same would appli to foreign parti unless there is someth peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio n you are deal with both confirm both confirm have languag that say that if the parti have not enter into an isda master then the counterparties01 standard form control i think it is not a good idea to agre to such languag becaus you are agre to someth you know noth about addit comment i think that whenev a counterparti request registr right rex should be involv i think the csfb confirmation01 provis relat to registr are fine and of cours they can01t forc us to regist becaus the choic of net share settl is pure our choic nevertheless i think that rex need to be involv so you and rex need to get this point across to the busi peopl that they shouldn01t just sign a confirm and then send it to you and ask if it is ok but my bottom line is the onli chang i would make would be elimin the net cash settlement featur in the csfb confirm'

evanslonectect maroun j abboudylonectect subject margauxwhitew rontrinaben i want to touch base with you on some margauxrel issu for whitew and determin what the appropri cours of action is as a brief descript of the margaux transact in case you have not been updat recent the margaux transact will now occur through the synthet transfer of risk to the noteholdersmargaux equiti the method by which this occur is as follow whitew continu to hold the equiti interest in the asset exclud 56 of trakya etol approx 3125 of sutton bridg 50 of nowa sarzyna and approx 50 of teessid all of which are held by enron whitew enter into a fix for float swap with ena with whitew make a fix annual payment to ena in an amount repres the base case cash flow of the under asset and ena make a float payment to whitew that is initi equal to the fix payment from whitew but is adjust downward if certain identifi negat thing happen at the various project therebi transfer certain of the risk of the project through the float leg concurr margaux the issuer rais approx 511 mm of capit and through a wholllyown subsidiari purchas the float leg receiv from whitew for 511 mm in other word whitew enter into the swap and immedi monet it receiv to margaux the net result is that whitew receiv cash proceed up front and has a fix payment oblig to ena and ena has a float payment oblig to margaux ive attach a structur diagram below with this in mind the follow issu relat to whitew have arisen the tax group would like to character the payment ena receiv from whitew as a prefer partnership distribut see attach note from donett dewar below my question is how do we achiev this result first is whitew lp abl to enter into this transact itself or doe it need to occur at a subsidiari level in other word doe the swap fall under the definit of indebted claus viii perhap in the whitew lp agreement which is prohibit at the whitew level if it cannot is se acquisit the best candid to be ena counterparti or do we run into issu with the natwest facil although theyd like consent sinc they will get repaid out of the proceed of the transact onc the issu of who is the appropri counterparti has been determin we need to discuss the mechan by which we effect the transact if we are inde go to open up the whitew lp agreement i suspect that annmari will need to revisit the alloc and distribut section which is probabl no easi task if not and the transact will occur at a subsidiari level we need to determin where also im sure this transact will requir certificatehold approv as it is in excess of the 40mm threshold a final logist issu that donett rais in her note is who will be respons for the legal work requir at the whitew level more general are there ani other legal or other issu that you see with respect to this transact from a whitew perspect if youd like to discuss the transact further pleas let me know ill be in houston the earli part of next week so perhap we can spend some time discuss

price indic all of the swap agreement involv financi institut must be regist with cetip or with anoth custodi and clear system author by the central bank or the cvm brazilian sec as a matter of practic the agreement use by the bank that particip in the swap market do not follow a standard form sinc normal each bank has a particular sampl form with which it feel more comfort deriv in addit to exchangetrad deriv and otc swap involv financi institut there is no legal impedi in principl to deriv transact be privat negoti and enter into between two interest parti as a general rule in brazil as long as no specif prohibit is found in the law parti are free to negoti agreement that best suit their interest intern hedg central bank regul author that brazilian compani enter into transact abroad either in exchang or have a financi institut as their counterpart to hedg against the fluctuat of interest rate exchang rate or commod price in the intern market such hedg transact must refer to payment in foreign currenc schedul to be made by or to the brazilian compani in respect of commerci or financi right or oblig or to payment in local currenc aris out of certain financi oblig subject to the variat of exchang rate and payment relat to import export or local transact involv commod price accord to their valuat in foreign exchang the commerci market exchang rate are applic to foreign

bank within 10 day of it execut when there is no registr with the central bank the bank execut the foreign exchang agreement relat to the hedg transact must verifi the exist of the obligationright be hedg exampl commod swap between two brazilian compani as per what has been said abov there is noth that preclud enron brazil of enter into a swap with anoth brazilian compani regard ani commod trade by enron pulp paper petrochem product power gas enron doe not need to be a financi institut to provid swap transact on the other hand i am not sure yet on the follow point 1 doe such swap agreement should be regist with cetip or ani other clear system to be valid under brazilian regul 2 what are the tax involv in a swap commod swap between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani this kind of deal seem to be also avail in the brazilian market and the onli differ from exampl 1 would be the fact that it must be regist with the central bank and it would involv transfer of foreign currenc commod swap between two offshor compani but involv brazilian export i am not sure if brazilian regul would have anyth to do with a transact like this one i would assum that a brazilian export would sell to their offshor subsidiari and such subsidiari would sell to their end custom enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshor subsidiari of the brazilian compani therefor enron would not have ani involv with brazilian regul becaus it would not be deal with brazil prepay pulp paper petrochem power the regul current in forc govern export prepay especi central bank of brazil cartacircular 2624 of februari 14 1996 establish that all repay of princip under such transact must necessarili be made by mean of shipment of the relev export good cartacircular 2624 allow cash remitt abroad onli in regard to payment of interest under the facil therefor it is not possibl to structur a transact where the repay of princip will be made onli in cash or where the borrow has the abil to choos between pay cash or export the good a transact that involv structur a direct loan to the brazilian compani where the valu of the princip of which would be tie to the price of the relev commod is veri difficult to be approv under a direct loan regist with the central bank the borrow may remit all due amount of princip and interest in accord with the schedul of payment attach to the certif of registr the problem with such altern is that although there are no express regul prevent it to do so the central bank will most probabl not issu a prior author for such type of loan as it onli normal issu author for normal loan where the princip is a fix amount and the interest rate is either a fix rate or a float rate normal base on libor or us treasuri it should also be note that general speak all interest payment under such an agreement are subject to withhold tax at the rate of 15 pa cc 5 account a possibl altern way to structur a prepay would be by use a nonregist loan with the central bank under such altern the fund disburs by enron under the loan would be remit to brazil through an intern transfer of brazilian currenc as allow by circular 2677 of the central bank of brazil the intern transfer of brazilian currenc intern transfer is a system which use a nonresid current account in brazil and the brazilian interbank foreign exchang market to effect remitt of fund to and from brazil under such system a lender that wish to disburs fund to a brazilian borrow make a foreign currenc deposit with a bank locat outsid of brazil offshor bank and instruct the offshor bank to deliv such dollar to a brazilian bank in exchang for brazilian currenc such brazilian currenc is then deposit in a nonresid account held by the offshor bank in brazil and thereaft transfer to the borrow the repay follow the invers procedur ie the borrow deposit the amount in a nonresid account of an offshor bank and instruct it to exchang the fund into foreign currenc and deliv them to the lender abroad the main differ between the regist loan and the nonregist loan are that the nonregist loan are not subject to prior approv by the central bank of brazil and therefor not subject to scrutini as to their minimum tenor and applic interest rate and the applic foreign exchang rate to nonregist loan is the float rate as oppos to the commerci rate of exchang all transfer of fund to brazil as intern transfer are subject to a financi transact tax iof at the rate of 2 on the amount transfer plus a bank fee that normal rang from 04 to 06 of such amount ani interest payment under a nonregist loan are subject to withhold tax at the rate of 15 or 25 if the lender is locat in a taxhaven jurisdict i dont think this type of transact is the best way to circumv some of the brazilian regul regard prepay given the bad press that deal via the cc 5 account mechan would bring to enron but i have it address just in case someon doe not share the same opinion exampl financi prepay between two brazilian compani not allow unless the compani provid the prepay qualifi as a financi institut as per brazilian law sinc it will not be the case in enron case we should not focus in these kind of transact financi prepay between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani as it has been mention befor it is allow as long as enron can structur the prepay in way where there is a preestablish amort schedul for princip and interest it is veri hard to structur a prepay with specif split between princip and interest becaus the object of the prepay is to lock on a certain volum of a product and not on a specif price therefor if enron prepay for a specif product on a float basi the attach valu of that commod can go up or down as the market fluctuat as well as the total valu associ to the deal such valu can be either princip or interest and it is imposs to determin what it will be financi prepay between two offshor compani but one be a subsidiari of a brazilian entiti i think there is no restrict in this case given the whole deal will be close offshor and the brazilian author are not go to be involv it will most like be a deal involv three parti a compani in brazil it offshor subsidiari and enron physic prepay between two brazilian compani no restrict physic prepay between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani no restrict as long as there is physic deliveri physic prepay between two offshor compani but involv brazilian export no restrict it would also involv three parti a compani in brazil it offshor subsidiari and enron thank gustavo'

permiss of rbi veena your activ chart show that form ts 1 is to be file after the sale is effect money receiv and at the time of remitt of sale proceed sinc the act prescrib prior approv we should sell onli after receipt of rbi approv and not befor the requisit form to be file for seek approv is form ts1 if we are effect the sale through a privat arrang the applic should be support with the averag quotat of the share price averag of daili high and low for one week proceed the date of applic duli certifi by a charter account if the sale propos to be effect on the floor of the exchang to the general public at the prevail market price the charter account certif is not requir sinc we intend sell at the floor this certif is not requir b thin trade i refer to veena queri on whether genesi share are thin trade per section 10 explan i the share will be treat as thin trade if the annualis trade turnov in that share on a main stock exchang in india dure the six calendar month preced the month in which the applic is made is less than 2 by number of share of the list stock though we can take a view that genesi share are list for trade onli from 5 june 2000 it is to be note that the new share issu to a the erstwhil genesi sharehold are issu as a result of the scheme of amalgam approv by the high court mumbai b the applic of the privat placement incl enron and the new amalgam compani genesi intern corpor limit whose previous name was aek trade and invest limit was a list compani at the mumbai stock exchang henc it is advis to check whether the share of aek were thin trade or not fyi the paid up equiti of aek prior to the amalgam was 240000 equiti share of rs 10 each aggreg rs 2400000 we can appli the test as explain abov on the aek share prior to genesi amalgam just to satisfi ourselv that it was not thin trade it is better to check this provis c formal for remitt per section 11of the fema regul remitt of sale proceed shall be made by a authoris dealer upon satisfi himself that the secur was held by the seller on repatri basi we need to submit the foreign collabor approv letter no 39 sianfc 99 nri to the ad submiss of the contract note of the broker effect the

we need not obtain the noc of the it in my view sinc the regul stipul an noc tcc from the it depart i doubt whether it is doabl without a boc tcc of the it in the past this was follow and with an undertak from the compani support with a charter account certificateconfirm there are no tax implic in the under transact one could remit the fund without a noctcc from it but given a veri specif statement us 11 of the fema regul and the same be introduc onli from 1 june and hasnt been time test i doubt whether the authoris dealer will accept our view and effect fund transfer with an undertak and ca certif in my view noc would be a pre requisit e bank account assum that the noc is requir there will be a time differ between we receiv the sale proceed and remit the money to mauritius after obtain the noc from it it is certain not advis to hold the instrument without encash it henc open of a bank account in india to encash the instrument is warrant i refer to mike mail on allow the broker to hold the fund in a trust account for edvmhc in my view instead of the broker hold the same the ad himself can hold it on trust for edvmhc but this need to check and proper document with the bank authoris dealer and as well at edvmhc from due dilig and complianc point of view i would suggest to take the rout of open of an rupe bank account than the trust rout sinc it is not a demat share open of an custodi account is not requir this need to be check with the authoris dealer f applic to rbi ts 1 i suggest that while make the rbi applic under ts 1 it is advis to state and seek their

and walk him through with the transact so that the approv is obtain at the earliest g origin fund i understand that while make this invest the fund have not come in from edvmhc mauritius or it has come from a compani from caymon island tax need to confirm whether the money receiv from cayco though on behalf of an mauritius compani would qualifi for tax benefit h confirm by genesi on non lockin there are no document avail like the board resolut while allot the share to edvmhc or the applic to stock exchang which would specifi distinct number of the lockin share nor it is state in the inform memorandum as whether share offer under this im are freeli tradabl though the sebi guidelin are clear that if the share do not form part of the promot quoto they are freeli tradabl it is advis that we

under the applic rule of evid csa bii elig collater i believ we discuss ad treasuri with matur greater than one year we propos treasuri under one year with a valuat percentag of 99 15 year at 97 and

collater a transact upon the occurr of these event becaus if at the end of the remedi period the transact is termin then the post collater will be return if applic accord to the normal procedur of the csa if the transact is termin and the settlement amount is not paid then the nonaffect parti has the right to liquid the collater to satisfi it claim and you would want all transact includ the affect transact to be fulli collater at that time csa f disput resolut i we can agre to two local busi day to resolv a disput ii we suggest that the parti look to market standard screen befor poll dealer to determin valu this is our standard definit of valu valu for the purpos of paragraph 5ic and 5ii the valu of post collater other than cash will be equal to the sum of i the face valu of the post collater multipli by the product of a either x the close bid price as quot by bloomberg financi market or dow jone teler servic as of resolut time or y the sum of the arithmet mean of the close bid

a parti pursuant to ani applic provis of this agreement or includ in the applic price refer to in i of this claus as of such date iii we can agre to transfer onli the undisput amount csa g hold and use post collater i have sever thought on this section the credit rate for a parti should includ both sp and moodi and a parti abil to hold post collater should be base on the lower of those two howev if the post collater is a letter of credit then a parti should be entitl to hold the letter of credit regardless of their credit rate under the term of gi the parti and it custodian are individu entitl to hold post collater howev there are no requir for a custodian i believ the requir of a qualifi institut should appli to the custodian if there is a rate requir for the parti in order for it to hold post collater and the parti is no longer in complianc with that rate requir then in order to compli with the general term of the csa the parti would have to transfer the post collater to a custodian which met the requir of a custodian or els it would be in breach of the agreement which would be an event of default if not remedi within 30 day therefor if you appli the requir of a qualifi institut to a custodian under gi then gii2 and 3 can be remov final we would like the requir of the custodian to be a rate of at least aa2 and have total asset of at least us 10000000000 csa hiii altern to interest amount subparagraph a should not appli in the event that the downgrad parti is the secur parti and they were at the time of downgrad hold post collater and post collater is move to a custodian there is no reason whi the pledgor who was not downgrad should be penal by not receiv interest payment in the form of cash when they are paid on the post collater as a matter of fact it is my understand that it is more difficult oper to reinvest such fund and much easier to pay them to the pledgor csa m other provis the definit of feder fund effect rate is not necessari pleas amend the definit of letter of credit to reflect the requir of the issu bank to includ a rate of aa2 and have total asset of at least us 10000000000 the definit of materi advers chang should be amend to reflect the rate of both moodi and sp exhibit a letter of credit provis b pleas delet the parenthet in line 3 to 4 and conform i to the amend definit of letter of credit with respect to the requir of the issu bank dii y should be entitl to draw under the lc in accord with the provis of paragraph 8 of the csa and not onli upon the occurr of an event of default the first sentenc of this section should be amend accord e pleas clarifi the intent of this section it is rather confus as written schedul i the statement to be present to the issu bank should conform to the circumst under paragraph 8 of the

with respect to interest and dividend payment each of which could aris dure the cours of our trade relationship my colleagu in the tax dept said he would prefer that dlj certifi that it is a foreign taxpay entitl to receiv payment under the document without reduct for withhold or other tax he said that dlj would not be abl to certifi to this if the form of the document is the usual veri broad form wherebi it permit transact of everi type both on and off market swap off market swap be swap involv a lend aspect and thus the under document might have to be curtail 2 document to be deliv for

the ca 4 setoff as you request i had a look at amend our claus to more close reflect the isda setoff claus but with the inclus of the nondefault parti affili upon review the claus in the document is veri similar to the isda claus except for the 1st two sentenc which bring in the nondefault parti affili which we have agre to have the onli other sentenc in the claus that differ from the isda is the one which talk about convers of the earli termin amount our languag goe ahead and make it clear that all amount need to to be convert to the termin currenc i think that is help thus i would propos to

no subject  as promis this email discuss the secur law issu involv with equiti deriv i then make a few observ about the relationship between the secur and commod law and i then make some comment on the confirm you sent me both secur law comment and other comment the princip secur law issu relat to the fact that the equiti deriv itself is a secur and to the issu of whether and to what extent a counterparty01 activ in establish or unwind a hedg are attribut to the issuer when enron enter into a deriv and the counterparti goe out into the market to make a purchas is that purchas attribut to enron when it unwind it hedg by make a sale is the counterparty01 sale attribut to enron and therefor requir to be regist here are the princip issu 1 rule 10b5 when enron enter into a deriv it must be sure it doe not have undisclos materi insid inform regard it affair it is my understand that the trader are suppos to check with rex roger on the issu of whether enron possess such inform although it could discharg it oblig under rule 10b5 by disclos the inform to the counterparti that would probabl be unaccept sinc the counterparti would then be in possess of materi insid inform and could not engag in a market transact to hedg thus each time it enter into an equiti deriv in it own stock enron must be confid that the public has avail to it all materi inform regard enron 2 rule 10b18 this rule permit issuer and person act in concert with issuer to repurchas the issuer01 share under a 01safe harbor018 that say in effect tha t if purchas are made pursuant to the rule they won01t be deem to be manipul by reason of the tim ing and amount of the bid or purchas it is typic for an issuer to requir it counterparti to make purchas pursuant to the rule sometim this is a contractu undertak in the confirm and in some case the issuer will simpli obtain an oral commit from the counterparti to engag in it hedg pursuant to the rule obvious it is better to have it in write 3 registr of sale if enron decid to net share settl and issu share to the counterparti those are obvious restrict secur that cannot be sold by the counterparti in the absenc of a registr statement but what about the resal by the issuer when it unwind it hedg that it has put on by buy share in the open market are those sale attribut to the issuer so therefor requir to be regist i have seen lot of counterparti base on advic of their law firm take differ posit on this a some counterparti say that they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer if the econom of the deriv are determin base on the net proceed from the sale it 01s a more difficult case becaus the issuer itself is realiz benefit and detriment from the sale b some counterparti say they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer onli if there is a strong correl at the onset of the contract between the term of the deriv and the hedg it it01 a total return swap for exampl there will be a 11 correspond ie the econom will tell you that the counterparti will buy 100 of the share cover by the swap immedi upon enter into the swap but if it01 someth like a collar with diverg strike price and involv dynam hedg where it01 not clear whether and to what extent the counterparti will make purchas or sale in the ope n market then it01 not as easi to attribut the counterparty01 action to the issuer in those case these counterparti look at the correl and if it01 not that great they don01t ask for registr right c some counterparti say they don01t want registr right for resa les of stock purchas in the open market to hedg their posit credit suiss first boston fall in categori c with respect to the may 200 0 confirm you sent me even though there is a strong correl between the deal and the hedg e ie even though in that case they will no doubt immedi purchas 100 of the share cover by the transact they are onli ask for registr right with respect to the share that are deliv by enron on net share settlement 4 commod law under the commod law there are some risk in do equiti swap in that one has to reli on the swap polici statement rather than the swap exempt but those risk are probabl minim enough that enron is will to take them the swap exempt doe not cover equiti swap with respect to equiti option they are outsid the cftc01s jurisdict altogeth forward contract present the most difficult issu in that there is a lot of case law and cftc lore about the distinct between forward and futur and a key distinct is that forward are physic deliveri contract that bind the parti to make and take deliveri state bucket shop law outlaw contract that purport to be contract for sale of a secur that are to be settl base on market price quotat so i would counsel enron not to enter into ani forward contract that has a cash settlement altern although one can argu that net share settlement has the same defect i don01t feel as strong about that bec aus you could get to where you want to get by physic deliv the share and issu new share s in payment the theori is that you actual deliv share and just net them out that is not quit as bad as fli in the face of the case law and cftc lore on net cash settlement the bear stearn confirm and cancel i realli don01t have ani comment on this i think the cancel was effect to cancel the parti oblig the confirm did not present ani registr issu i guess i would say that if you do someth precisel y like this you might get them to agre to make ani hedg purchas pursuant to rule 10b18 but that01 it the credit suiss first boston confirm this is an extrem well written document for the reason discuss abov i would counsel against enter into this kind of transact with the cash settlement featur in light of the risk that it could be character as an illeg unenforc futur contract a few other comment they say automat earli termin appli but i think that is a realli bad idea enron had an agreement with a counterparti that took bankruptci and enron did not find out about it until a few day later after the market had move sinc enron di d not know of the termin it did not unwind it hedg yet the isda said that the amount payabl on termin would depend on the termin date price so enron took a loss you ought to alway have within your control the right to termin this is especi true of us parti but i would think the same would appli to foreign parti unless there is someth peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio n you are deal with both confirm both confirm have languag that say that if the parti have not enter into an isda master then the counterparties01 standard form control i think it is not a good idea to agre to such languag becaus you are agre to someth you know noth about addit comment i think that whenev a counterparti request registr right rex should be involv i think the csfb confirmation01 provis relat to registr are fine and of cours they can01t forc us to regist becaus the choic of net share settl is pure our choic nevertheless i think that rex need to be involv so you and rex need to get this point across to the busi peopl that they shouldn01t just sign a confirm and then send it to you and ask if it is ok but my bottom line is the onli chang i would make would be elimin the net cash settlement featur in the csfb confirm'
